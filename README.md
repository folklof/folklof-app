This is the web server GitHub repository of Folklof, the home of innovation in educational technology. We've crafted a robust software architecture to power our Story Teller Platform, an exceptional educational tool designed to champion the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through cutting-edge AI storytelling and interactive reading experiences for children.

In the era of rapid globalization and technological advancement, quality education is paramount in achieving the SDGs and advancing global civilization. Our Story Teller platform is a beacon of innovation in education, seamlessly integrating AI-based storytelling technology with interactive reading experiences. The primary goal is to provide equitable access to high-quality learning resources for children from diverse backgrounds, with a focus on nurturing literacy, fostering creativity, and promoting inclusivity.

This platform directly addresses challenges in education, such as limited access to quality reading materials and the need for engaging learning methods. By tailoring stories to each child's needs and interests, the platform not only enhances literacy skills but also inspires children to learn and explore the world through their imagination.
